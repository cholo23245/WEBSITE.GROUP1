        Gender Issues: Unveiling the Persistence of Gender Inequalities: Challenging Stereotypes in Evolving Societies
        
        Gender relationships are changing and inequalities between men and women are questioned in virtually every sphere – at work, in the home, and in public affairs. Yet the cold, hard facts show that gender gaps and inequalities persist, even in the face of startling social and economic transformations and concerted movements to challenge women’s subordination. How can this be? Especially in advanced industrial nations, why are gender inequalities proving so difficult to surpass? Day by day people use gender as taken-for-granted common sense to manage their relationships with others. Interpersonal negotiations are constantly influenced by gender stereotypes – and that, in turn, causes older ways of thinking about men and women and their relationships to be carried into all spheres of life and even into very new kinds of tasks and social settings.
        (In this perspective, the gender issue is the ongoing discrimination and inequality against women in many areas of life, especially in developed industrialized nations, in spite of social and economic changes and initiatives to eliminate women's subjugation. The usage of gender stereotypes as common sense that is taken for granted contributes to this problem by influencing interpersonal interactions and bringing outdated ideas about men and women into all areas of life, including new tasks and social situations.)
